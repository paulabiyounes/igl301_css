in the 1990s and 2000s, office environments were a mechanism to make a quick buck (on the developers' side)
and to save money (on the tenants' side). The office environments built with these short-term views have
deteriorated, because their quality was low. Now, with many office spaces lying vacant, our company sees
the value in adding qualities to office environments which are higher than usual, in order to stand out.
